# Mobility_Calculator
A simple widget that estimates the mobility of a sample measured with OPTP (TRTS) spectroscopy with the carrier density estimation method

One executed from terminal ha an intuitive GUI that allows to estimate the mobility.
To obtain accurate estimation the power provided should be the absorbed power, taking into account possi ble reflection lossess and a finite transmission.
The are of the beam is considered: 1/(2 * pi * s^2 + st^2) where s is the pump beam std dev and st is the THz beam std dev
